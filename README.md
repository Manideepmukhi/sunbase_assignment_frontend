## Used simple HTML, CSS , JAVA Script for creating the front end

## Src- Index.html (login page)

## Credentials for login

"login_id" : "test@sunbasedata.com",
"password" :"Test@123"

Sync button is will not show results as the Remote API is not returning data when TOKEN is passed.

TOKEN has been stored in the client side(front end part) for calling remote API.

## Features 

## 1.Login 
## 2.List of Customers
## 3.Add customer option
## 4.Delete Customer

 NOTE- I HAVE TRIED TO ADD PAGINATION AND SORTING IN THE BACKEND PART BUT 
 DUE TO SOME UNUSUAL BEHAVIOUR OF SPRINGBOOT SYSTEM GETMAPPING IS NOT RETURING FOR THESE FUNNTIONS
 HENCE CANNOT ADD FRONTEND FOR THAT IN THIS CASE.
